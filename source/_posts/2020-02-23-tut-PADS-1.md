## Create a new part

0. We will use PADS Logic to create a new part.
1. select your part will create at which library. 
...It is suggested to create your own library. After create library, remember click the `Manage Lib list` and add your library to the list. 
2. select `parts`.
3. Click `New...` to create new parts.

You need to change the `Design` grid and `display grid` the unit is mil (100mil = 0.1 inch). 
Design grid is the step size unit, it mean minimum move 10 mil 1 time.
display grid is the length between the background dot.

Save As..

The `Name of Part` is the name of this new part. The `CAE Decal 1` is the name of the logic symbol.
One part can have more than one logic symbol, so we can see we are naming the Gate A.
Normally I will just give them the same name.

Here it will pop out a warning message. `Part has no PCB Decal assigned.` 
we can just ignore it, the next tutorial will draw the PCB decal.
