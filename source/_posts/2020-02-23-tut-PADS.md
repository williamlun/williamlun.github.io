This is a tutorial of using PADS software to build your own PCB.

# Introduction #

In this tutorial, PADS Logic, PADS Layout, and PADS Router will be used. 
PADS Logic - use for build the circuit schematic.
PADS Layout - use for edit the component placement and how the in-kind board looks like.
PADS Router - use for auto routing.

# Library structure #

The most important thing before starting to build the circuit board is to understand the component Library structure of PADS software. 

The position of the `Library`.

After clicking the `Library` option, the Library Manager will show like this.

At the top, you can select which Library you are using. Also, you can Manage the library list and create a new library. I will suggest you create a new library to save all your own parts. 

At PADS library, a component is called as a part. A parts contain a logic(symbol) and one or few decals(package). The logic and decals can be share to build different parts. For example, the surface mount component of the resistor and capacitor share a same package 0805. So the 0805 decals can be assigned to the ressistor and capacitor.

Btw, if you use the PADS logic open the Library Manager and check the Parts, the preview is the logic symbol. If you use PADS layout to check, it will be the default decals of that part. 

# Preparations #

The first thing that must be to do some research to see how to build the circuit, is it already exist some similar board as a reference. And make sure the material and circuit fit your board. 

In this tutorial, I will build a lithium battery charging with a protection circuit as an example. In fact, the market already exists some modules like this. I will copy this module to finish this tutorial.

This module have 3 main component, which is `TP4056`, `DW01A`, and `8205A`.
We need to confirm we can get these 3 components or similar parts. If we can't get it, change the plan now! Don't find it after you finish your circuit board. It will waste your time.
I sure I can build this circuit using these components, then check the datasheet just get the idea of how the circuit works.

Now we can start to draw the parts.
