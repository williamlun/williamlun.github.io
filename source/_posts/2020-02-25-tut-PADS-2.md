This is a tutorial of using PADS software to build your own PCB.
___

At the last tutorial, we have finish the logic symbol of the new part.
Now we can draw the landing pattern, which is the package of your part.

## Use PADS layout to check the library

Open `PADS layout` Library Manager, you can see your part and shown as `NO DECAL`.

## Check the exist Decals

You can check the existing library decals, to find that you need to draw it or not.
You can type the keyword on the filter text box like this to search.
Remember to change the selected library on top.

## Create new Decals

When you confirm you need to draw a new decal.
Switch the `Filter` to `Decals`, and click `New...`.

## Change to grid and unit to fit your reference

This component is using a SOP-8 package, the land pattern is here and the unit is mm.
So, I will change the software setting to fit my reference to draw it easier.
Here is the reference land pattern.

We switch the `Design units` to `Metric`.

And also the `Design Grid` and `Display Grid` as you like.

## Start to draw something

You can add some line using the `Drafting Toolbar` -> `2D Line`.

You can first draw a probably size and you can see you mouse posistion from the origin at the right bottom.

## change the 2D Line drawing object

When you using the `2D Line`, you can right click and change the drawing to a circle or just a path.

Here I get something like this.

## Add Terminal 

Use the `Terminal` to add pin.

The pin will add in orderly, or you can change the setting here.

The part have 8 pin, so I just add 8 Terminal first.

## Change the Pad Stacks

We can select all of the Terminal and right-click, choose the `Pad Stacks...` to change the pin shape.

![](https://i.imgur.com/aL0DnKb.png)

Here is the pin pad stack properties.

1. The selected pin and the corresponding pin No..
2. The selected layer of this pin.
3. The pad parameter of selected layer of this pin.
4. The size of the drilling hole.
5. If you want the assign the change to all pin, just select it.

![](https://i.imgur.com/UDutsLZ.png)

Because our component is a SMD component,
We don't need to drill hole, `Drill size` set to 0.
The `Inner Layer` and the `Opposite Side` pad also set to 0.

Also change the parameter of the pad on the `Mounted Side`.

## place all thing on the corrct position

We can select the pin and right-click, select `Properties..`.

It will show the X Y position of this pin.

You can calculate the relative position of the pin and place it in the correct place.
Also, you can adjust your 2D line draft to get a better look.

Here is what I get.

## place the Name and Type

After place all the pin, I will change the size of the Name and Type and also place it on a better psition.

Also right-click -> `Properties..`

Naming

Click `NO!` when it ask you to create a new Part Type.

Then we can exit the editor.

## Combine the Decal to the Part

Open the Library Manager, we can see the part still show `NO DECAL`, we click `edit..`.

![](https://i.imgur.com/I0nWByc.png)

And go to the `PCB Decals`.

![](https://i.imgur.com/UHUrCmY.png)

Find the Decal we have created, you can  see the preview on top.

![](https://i.imgur.com/jjMMro4.png)

Click `Assign`, then `OK`.

Now we can see the part show our decal. We success to assign the decal to this part.
